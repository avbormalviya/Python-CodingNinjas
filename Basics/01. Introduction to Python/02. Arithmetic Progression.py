# Problem statement

""" You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference
and print it. """

# solution

# input first three entries of an arithmetic progression

firstEntries = int(input())
secondEntries = int(input())
thirdEntries = int(input())

# calculate the common difference

commonDifference = thirdEntries - secondEntries

# print common difference

print(commonDifference)

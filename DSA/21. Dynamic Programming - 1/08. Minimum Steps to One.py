# Problem statement

""" Given a positive integer 'n', find and return the minimum number of steps that 'n' has to take to get reduced to 1.
You can perform any one of the following 3 steps:

1.) Subtract 1 from it. (n = n - Â­1) ,
2.) If n is divisible by 2, divide by 2.( if n % 2 == 0, then n = n / 2 ) ,
3.) If n is divisible by 3, divide by 3. (if n % 3 == 0, then n = n / 3 ).  """

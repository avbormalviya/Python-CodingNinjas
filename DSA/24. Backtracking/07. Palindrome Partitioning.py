# Problem statement

""" You are given a string 'S'. Your task is to partition 'S' such that every substring of the
partition is a palindrome. You need to return all possible palindrome partitioning of 'S'.

Note: A substring is a contiguous segment of a string.

For Example:
For a given string “BaaB”
3 possible palindrome partitioning of the given string are:
{“B”, “a”, “a”, “B”}
{“B”, “aa”, “B”}
{“BaaB”}
Every substring of all the above partitions of “BaaB” is a palindrome. """

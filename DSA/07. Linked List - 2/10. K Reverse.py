# Problem statement

""" Given a singly linked list of integers, reverse the nodes of the linked list 'k' at a time and return its
modified list.

 'k' is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not
 a multiple of 'k,' then left-out nodes, in the end, should be reversed as well.

Example :
Given this linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

For k = 2, you should return: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

For k = 3, you should return: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4

Note :
No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. Only return the new head to the list. """

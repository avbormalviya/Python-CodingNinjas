# Problem statement

""" You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with two integers, 'i,' and 'j.' Swap the nodes that are present at the 'i-th' and 'j-th' positions and return the new head to the list.

Note :
1. Remember, You need to swap the nodes, not only the data.
2. Indexing starts from 0.
3. No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. """

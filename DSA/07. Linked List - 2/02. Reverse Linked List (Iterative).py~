# Problem statement

""" Given a singly linked list of integers, reverse it iteratively and return the head to the modified list.

Note :
No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. Only return the new head to the list. """


# solution


from node_class import LinkedList


# Function to reverse a linked list recursively
def reverse(head):
    prev = None

    while head:
        next = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = next

    return prev
